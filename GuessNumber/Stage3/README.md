# Guess the Number - Stage 3
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 3 in the development of a basic guessing game.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. The JavaScript has been moved to its own file.
2. The number of guesses are counted and displayed.
3. A label has been added to the guess text box.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. Display a new mesage if the guess is not between 1 and 10.
2. Display a new mesage if the guess is not a number.
3. Add some colour!
4. After 3 guesses, tell the player that they have lost.
5. Don't allow more than 3 guesses.
