# Guess the Number - Stage 4
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 4 in the development of a basic guessing game.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. A new CSS style file has been added and applied to the HTML.
2. Only numbers can be entered.
3. The result is cleared each time the guess text box is selected.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. Use differnt styles for numbers that are too big or too small.
2. After 3 guesses, tell the player that they have lost. Don't allow more guesses.
3. Tell the user they are "hot", "warm" or "cold", instead of being too small or large. Display "hot" for within 5 and warm within 10 of the correct answer. Extend the guessing range to be from 1 to 50.
4. Remove the "Submit guess" button so the player just needs to hit Enter to guess.
5. Add a Restart button to start again when the game is over.
