# Guess the Number - Stege 1
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 1 in the development of a basic guessing game.

Try to make these improvements to the game:

1. Display a mesage if the guess is not between 1 and 10.
2. Display a mesage if the guess is not a number.
3. Count the number of guesses and display as part of the result.
