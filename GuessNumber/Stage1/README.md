# Guess the Number - Stege 1
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 1 in the development of a basic guessing game.

Try to make these improvements to the game:

1. Add the label "Enter a guess:" before the text box.
2. Display a new mesage if the guess is not between 1 and 10.
3. Display a new mesage if the guess is not a number.
4. Add some colour!
5. Count the number of guesses and display as part of the result.
