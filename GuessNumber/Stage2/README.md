# Guess the Number - Stege 2
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 2 in the development of a basic guessing game.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. The game is now a simple web application.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. Add the label "Enter a guess:" before the text box.
2. Display a new mesage if the guess is not between 1 and 10.
3. Display a new mesage if the guess is not a number.
4. Add some colour!
5. Count the number of guesses and display as part of the result.
