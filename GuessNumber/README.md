# Guess the Number
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

Try to make these improvements to the game:

1. Display the number of guesses so far after each guess.
2. Use differnt styles for numbers that are too big or too small.
3. After 3 guesses, tell the player that they have lost. Don't allow more guesses.
4. Tell the user they are "hot", "warm" or "cold", instead of being too small or large. Display "hot" for within 5 and warm within 10 of the correct answer. Extend the guessing range to be from 1 to 50.
5. Remove the "Submit guess" button so the player just needs ot hit Enter to guess.
