# Wordle - Stage 3
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 3 in the development of Wordle.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. The game model now handles user input and calculates the letter colours.
2. Sample data is removed from the game and UI files.
3. There is no chnage to the wordle.html, wordle.css or wordle_app.js files.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:
