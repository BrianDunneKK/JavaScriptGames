# Wordle - Stage 2
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 2 in the development of Wordle.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. A simple Wordle JavaScript app (wordle_app.js) is added. This is loaded by the HTML file.
2. The sample words are removed from the HTML file.
3. A JavaScript game class is added (wordle_game.js) but it has no logic yet. 
4. The JavaScript UI class is added to display previous guesses, with colouring, and the latest guess.
