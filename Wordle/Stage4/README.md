# Wordle - Stage 4
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 4 in the development of Wordle.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. The game model determines if you have won or lost.
2. The UI displays a message depending on whether you've won or lost.
3. A list of common words and a lkist of all allowed words are loaded.
4. Select the secret word from the common word list.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. Prevent the user from entering new words after they have lost
2. Display the secret word after the player has lost.
3. Allow the user to use backspace to delete the last letter entered.
