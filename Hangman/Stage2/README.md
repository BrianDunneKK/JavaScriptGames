# Hangman - Stege 3
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 3 in the development of Hangman.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. The game is now a simple web application.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. Add a space between each letter of the guess
2. After the player loses, display the word.
3. Hide the outcome bar and Restart button until the player has won or lost.
4. Prevent the player from continuing to guess after the game is over.
