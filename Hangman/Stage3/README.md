# Hangman - Stage 3
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

This is Stage 3 in the development of Hangman.

In this stage, these improvements have been made:

1. A new CSS style file has been added and applied to the HTML.
2. Add an icon.
3. Add support to guess using keystrokes.
4. Disable letter buttons as they are pressed.

Try to make these additional improvements to the game:

1. After the player loses, display the word.
2. Change the game so that mixed case words can be used (e.g. JavaScript).
3. Hide the outcome bar and Restart button until the player has won or lost.
4. Display the man in red if the player loses.
5. Prevent the player from continuing to guess after the game is over.
