# Hangman
JavaScript game created by CoderDojo Kilkenny

Try to make these improvements to the game:

1. After the player loses, display the word.
2. Change the game so that mixed case words can be used (e.g. JavaScript).
3. Hide the Restart button until the player has won or lost.
4. Display the man in red if the player loses.
5. Prevent the player from continuing to guess after the game is over.
6. In Stage1, add a space between letters when displaying the guesses.

Note: The Stage1 folder must contain package.json with the contents: { "type": "module" }"
